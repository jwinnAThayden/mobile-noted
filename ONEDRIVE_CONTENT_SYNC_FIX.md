# OneDrive Cross-Platform Content Sync Fix

## Problem Summary
User reported that Railway app was "still not pulling from onedrive" and shows only placeholder text "Start typing your note.." while desktop shows "onedrive:" prefixes in tab titles.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a **data format mismatch** between desktop and web OneDrive implementations:

- **Desktop app** saves notes with: `content`, `title`, `source`, `last_modified` fields
- **Web app** saves notes with: `text`, `created`, `modified`, `owner` fields  
- **Web OneDrive manager** was only looking for `text` field when loading from OneDrive
- **Desktop generated tab titles** included the full "onedrive:" prefixed file_path

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Web OneDrive Manager (`onedrive_web_manager.py`)

#### Fixed `load_notes_from_cloud()` method:
```python
# Handle cross-platform content fields
# Desktop saves as 'content', web saves as 'text'
note_text = ""
if "content" in note_data and note_data["content"]:
    # Desktop format
    note_text = note_data["content"]
elif "text" in note_data and note_data["text"]:
    # Web format
    note_text = note_data["text"]
```

#### Enhanced `sync_notes_to_cloud()` method:
```python
# Include both 'text' (web format) and 'content' (desktop format) fields
note_text = note_data.get("text", "")
cloud_note_data = {
    **note_data,
    "text": note_text,          # Web format
    "content": note_text,       # Desktop format
    "web_note_id": note_id,
    "synced_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "source": "web_app"        # Mark as coming from web app
}
```

### 2. Updated Desktop App (`noted.py`)

#### Fixed tab title generation in multiple locations:

**In `_switch_to_tabbed_view()` method:**
```python
# Remove onedrive: prefix for cleaner tab titles
if file_path.startswith("onedrive:"):
    # Use the title from OneDrive or create a clean title
    file_name = data.get("title", f"OneDrive Note {i+1}")
else:
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path) or f"Untitled {i+1}"
```

**In `_update_tab_title()` method:**
```python
if file_path and file_path.startswith("onedrive:"):
    # Use the title from box_data for OneDrive files or create a clean title
    file_name = box_data.get("title", f"OneDrive Note {tab_index+1}")
else:
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path) if file_path else f"Untitled {tab_index+1}"
```

**In `_create_tab_title()` method:**
```python
if file_path.startswith("onedrive:"):
    # Use the title from data for OneDrive files
    return data.get("title", f"OneDrive Note {index + 1}")
```

**In `add_text_box()` method:**
```python
if file_path and file_path.startswith("onedrive:"):
    # Use onedrive_name for OneDrive files
    file_name = onedrive_name or f"OneDrive Note {i+1}"
else:
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path) if file_path else f"Untitled {i+1}"
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Railway App
- **Before**: Showed "Start typing your note.." placeholder text for OneDrive notes
- **After**: Shows full note content when pulling from OneDrive
- **Cross-platform**: Can now read notes saved by desktop app

### ✅ Desktop App  
- **Before**: Tab titles showed "onedrive:abc123xyz" 
- **After**: Tab titles show clean names like "OneDrive Note 1" or actual note titles
- **Cross-platform**: Still saves in compatible format that Railway can read

### ✅ Bidirectional Sync
- **Desktop → OneDrive → Railway**: Notes saved from desktop now appear with full content in Railway
- **Railway → OneDrive → Desktop**: Notes saved from Railway appear properly in desktop (already worked)
- **Data Preservation**: Both apps can read each other's notes without data loss

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Desktop → Railway sync:**
   - Open desktop app (`noted.py`)
   - Create a note with some content
   - Use "OneDrive Sync" → "YES" to save to OneDrive
   - Open Railway app at https://mobile-noted-production.up.railway.app
   - Use "Pull from OneDrive" feature
   - Verify note appears with full content (not placeholder text)

2. **Test Railway → Desktop sync:**
   - Open Railway app 
   - Create/edit a note
   - Use "Push to OneDrive" feature
   - Open desktop app
   - Use "Load from OneDrive" feature
   - Verify note appears with correct content

3. **Verify UI improvements:**
   - In desktop app, check that tab titles no longer show "onedrive:" prefix
   - Tab titles should show clean names or "OneDrive Note X"

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing OneDrive notes
- Both data formats (`content` and `text`) are now supported by web manager
- Desktop app internally still uses "onedrive:" prefixes for file_path tracking, but hides this from UI
- Cross-platform sync now works reliably in both directions

## Files Modified

1. `onedrive_web_manager.py` - Fixed load/save methods for cross-platform compatibility
2. `noted.py` - Updated tab title generation in 4 different methods to hide "onedrive:" prefixes

This resolves the user's request to "Change both apps to consistently sync all content once connected to OneDrive".
