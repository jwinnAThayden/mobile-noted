## OneDrive Cross-Platform Sync Fix Summary

### âœ… Problem Identified
The desktop and web OneDrive managers were using different scopes and potentially different endpoints, causing them to access different locations in OneDrive:

- **Desktop**: `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder` scope â†’ App-specific folder
- **Web (before fix)**: `https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.ReadWrite` scope â†’ General OneDrive access

### âœ… Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Aligned Scopes**
Changed web OneDrive manager to use same scopes as desktop:
```python
# Before (web):
SCOPES = ["https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.ReadWrite"]

# After (web) - now matches desktop:
SCOPES = ["Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder", "User.Read"]
```

#### 2. **Confirmed Endpoint Compatibility**
Both versions already used the same API endpoint:
```python
GRAPH_API_ENDPOINT = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/special/approot"
```

#### 3. **Standardized File Format**
Both versions now save notes as `.json` files with the same structure and use compatible method signatures.

#### 4. **Added Compatible Interface Methods**
Added `get_note_content()` method to web manager to match desktop interface.

### âœ… Test Results
```
âœ… Core scopes are compatible!
âœ… Endpoints match!
âœ… Both versions access the same OneDrive AppFolder
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior Now
1. **Desktop sync** â†’ Saves notes to OneDrive AppFolder as `.json` files
2. **Web app "Pull from OneDrive"** â†’ Reads the same `.json` files from the same AppFolder
3. **Cross-platform sync** â†’ Both apps now work with the same OneDrive location!

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Test on Railway**: Deploy the updated web app to test cross-platform sync
2. **Verify desktop sync**: Use desktop app to sync notes to OneDrive
3. **Test web pull**: Use Railway app to pull notes from OneDrive
4. **Confirm sync works**: Notes synced from desktop should appear in Railway app

The fundamental compatibility issue has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
