# üö® Windows Build Issues and Solutions

## ‚ùå Current Issue: "Unknown command/target android"

You're encountering this error because **Buildozer has significant limitations on Windows**. The Android target is not properly recognized in Windows environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions (Recommended Order)**

### 1. üêß **Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - RECOMMENDED**

This is the most reliable solution for building Android APKs on Windows:

#### Install WSL2:
```powershell
# In PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

#### Setup in WSL2:
```bash
# After WSL2 Ubuntu is installed and running
cd /mnt/c/Users/jwinn/OneDrive\ -\ Hayden\ Beverage/Documents/py/noted/mobile-noted

# Install Python and dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build Android APK
python -m buildozer android debug
```

### 2. üîß **Use GitHub Actions (Cloud Build)**

Build your APK in the cloud using GitHub Actions:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow (see `github-actions-android.yml` example below)
3. Download built APK from Actions artifacts

### 3. üñ•Ô∏è **Use Android Studio Directly**

Convert the project to a native Android Studio project:
- Install Android Studio
- Create new project with Python support (Chaquopy plugin)
- Manually configure the build

### 4. üê≥ **Use Docker with Linux Container**

Run buildozer in a Linux Docker container:
```powershell
# Pull buildozer Docker image
docker pull kivy/buildozer

# Run build in container
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app kivy/buildozer android debug
```

## üìã **GitHub Actions Example**

Create `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`:

```yaml
name: Android Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install buildozer
        pip install -r mobile-noted/requirements.txt

    - name: Build Android APK
      working-directory: mobile-noted
      run: |
        buildozer android debug

    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: mobile-noted-debug
        path: mobile-noted/bin/*.apk
```

## üîç **Why This Happens**

Buildozer was designed primarily for Linux environments because:

1. **Android SDK/NDK** work more reliably on Linux
2. **Build tools** (gcc, make, etc.) are native to Linux
3. **Java/Python integration** is more stable
4. **File permissions** and paths work differently on Windows

## ‚ö° **Quick Test: WSL2 Method**

If you have WSL2 available, this is the fastest way to test:

```bash
# In WSL2 Ubuntu terminal
cd /mnt/c/Users/jwinn/OneDrive\ -\ Hayden\ Beverage/Documents/py/noted/mobile-noted

# Quick test build
python3 -m pip install buildozer
python3 -m buildozer android debug
```

## üì± **Alternative: Test on Desktop First**

While fixing the Android build, you can test the mobile app on desktop:

```bash
# In mobile-noted directory
python mobile-noted.py
```

This will run the Kivy app in a window, allowing you to test functionality before building for Android.

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**Use WSL2** for the best balance of convenience and reliability. It gives you a full Linux environment while staying on Windows, and buildozer works exactly as intended.

The GitHub Actions approach is also excellent for CI/CD and sharing builds with others.
