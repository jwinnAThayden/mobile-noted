## Technical Details

### Storage Structure
```
MobileNoted/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json          # App configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes_db.json        # Notes metadata database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/               # Individual note files

## Best Practices

### For OneDrive Users
- ‚úÖ Keep OneDrive app running for continuous sync
- ‚úÖ Ensure adequate OneDrive storage space
- ‚úÖ Regularly check OneDrive sync status
- ‚úÖ Use "Storage Info" to verify cloud status

### For Custom Storage Users
- ‚úÖ Choose accessible, persistent locations
- ‚úÖ Ensure write permissions for the app
- ‚úÖ Set up manual backup routines
- ‚úÖ Test path accessibility before migration

### For Local Storage Users
- ‚úÖ Regularly backup notes manually
- ‚úÖ Consider OneDrive upgrade for device sync
- ‚úÖ Be aware notes won't sync across devices
- ‚úÖ Use export features for sharing notes

## Troubleshooting

### OneDrive Not Detected
- **Check OneDrive installation**: Ensure OneDrive is installed and signed in
- **Verify environment variables**: OneDrive should set system environment variables
- **Manual path entry**: Use custom storage path with OneDrive folder path
- **Restart app**: Sometimes detection requires app restart

### Storage Access Issues
- **Check permissions**: Ensure app has write access to storage location
- **Verify path exists**: Custom paths must be valid and accessible
- **Fallback activation**: App will fallback to local storage if primary fails
- **Error logs**: Check console output for specific error messages

### Migration Problems
- **Free space**: Ensure destination has adequate free space
- **File conflicts**: Migration will overwrite existing files with same names
- **Partial migration**: If migration fails partway, some files may be duplicated
- **Recovery**: Original files remain unless "Move" option completes successfully

## Integration with Desktop Version

The mobile app shares the same storage structure and configuration as the desktop version, enabling:

- **Seamless switching**: Use desktop and mobile versions interchangeably
- **Shared configuration**: Settings sync between versions
- **Common file format**: Notes are compatible between desktop and mobile
- **Unified experience**: Same OneDrive integration across platforms

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Real-time sync indicators
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Integration with other cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Enhanced Android OneDrive integration
- Automatic sync scheduling options
